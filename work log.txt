20/9/2017 Skeleton of main.c coded set up adc conversion adc conversion in loop not tested, experiencing compiler issues (1300-1530)

21/9/2017 install xc8 compiler (i only had assembler :-( ) fucked around with code; still not recognizing all regs voltage divider designed (10k gives range of 1.26 V) (max range would be 13.416408k) (1000 - 1330)

22/9/2017 (1230 - 1730) Derek and I tried to make connection to PICkit 3. In MPLab IPE, we get <<Target device was not found (could not detect target voltage VDD). You must connect to a target device to use PICkit 3.>> when we try to connect to PIC16F18557. In IDE, we get <>. We have tried messing with power settings (we tried sourcing from PICkit, external, and both - same error) [with external, error = <>], we tried running ridiculously simple code like an infinite while loop and many online templates, and we have tried running code on several different computers - 2 in Ball-424, 1 in other lab, and my own PC. We searched online for things but the changes did not work. We tried setting up the breadboard like in http://www.instructables.com/id/Programming-PIC-Microcontrollers/ and we tried copying the pciture in the user guide from the instructor. Nothing works. We think there is a connection problem. HELP!!!!!!!!!!! We've been working all day. Update: Derek got it to work after TA responded to our email.

23/9/2017 Derek worked for a big portion of the day on the hardware and on getting the pickit to do things like blink an LED. Kyle got back to us and told us that his pwm module is coming along well. I am getting to work on the light sensor analog input code and on the led output code. It is 21:46. Update: I rewrote main.c. I learned from Derek how to reference the ANSEL bank. There are no compile errors but I have not run the code.

25/9/2017 (0950 - 1055 & 1220 - 1400) Derek and I worked on LED code.  We did not initialize all flags so we worked on that.  We quickly programmed the pickit to read analog input and blick the led a certain number of times for whatever voltage it read, but we always got zero.  In the end, we probably had functioing code before we realised it.  The pickit would only read analog input once.  For some reason, every first adc input is always zero.  When we fixed test code to always update, we realised adc converter was working (probably long before we got it to work).  We put in my original while loop that i programmed on 23/9 and it worked!!! (video with today's timestamp)  Super happy filled with high-fives.  Very happy.  We got PWM code from Kyle today.  Tomorrow, we will combine it with led code and put it into main.  I hope it works.  Now, at 2030 to 2201, I am redesigned github repo to make everything neat.

1630 - 1700: Putting two main functiosn together by myself.
1700 - ?: We could not get the PWM thing to work, so we worked for hours checking initializes.  Sometimes, perfectly good code would not build on my cmputer but it would build on Ball-424 computers.  So I worked on reinstalling stuff.  Not done, yet.  After working on trying to get PWM initializes to make PWN work, I quickly pulled put together code that would switch an output between 1 and 0 fast to give us the PWM square wave we needed, but the frequency was not good enough.  The senso-motor did not respond.  Next, Kyle worked on code that incorporated delay functions but also used generic output (like mine) without specific PWM functions.  He could not adjust certain things about the wave.  He suspects there is something wrong.  I am <<back-seat programming>>.
