1) Go to the home page for this repository while logged in.
2) Click <<fork>> to create a copy of this repository on your own account.
3) APPLY CHANGES TO DIFFERENT BRANCH!
	Fuck around with the code all you want, but commits/changes must only 
	be applied to a different branch, which you create on your copy of the 
	repository!
4) Go back to home page for this repository.
5) Click on <<New Pull Request>>.
6) Select the branch full of your changes that you would like to submit.
7) Submit the pull request and let it process.

Benefits of this method:
	1) Changes that you are working on yourself will stay with you until 
	you are finished.  This gives you more time work on your portion and 
	apply proper comments.  Only good code will be put into this Github.  
	Temporary/testing code will stay on old Github for quick transfers.
	2) Changes such as new functions and bug fixes will be tracked much 
	more easily.
	3) Changes can be reviewed and tested before being applied to our 
	public files.  This ensures that the files here will always be compilable 
	(but not necessarily functional).
	
Disadvantages:
	1) It takes longer to view your big changes in the Github.
	2) All changes are major, but because they are tested before being applied, 
	no changes should be detrimental to the project.

Notes: Our old github is a great place to quickly share files when we 
want to make changes to code that we are not yet ready to submit via a 
pull request.
