Laboratory 1 Information


<<provided materials>> folder holds all content that was provided to us from the professor
  
<<LED code.c>> is the main code for the LED

<<PWM Code.c>> is the main code for the PWM
  
The LED and PWM function together in <<main.c>>.

<<main.c>> must be built inside project template provided (to be found in <<provided materials>> folder)

Derek and Hans tried to get hardware working.  In the end, we emailed TA and Derek got the entire chip wired over 23-24/9 weekend.  Hans coded light sensor and led output, and he worked with Derek to fix register initialisations on 25/9 to get LED code working.

Meanwhile, Kyle coded PWM.
